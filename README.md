# Lists_sorting_and_binary_search
The user inputs numbers.
A program separates the numbers into three lists. 
The "Even one" is for adding even numbers. 
The "Odd one" is for adding odd numbers.
The third list is for adding all numbers.
When the user had finished entering the numbers he has to decide in which way the program will sort the lists.
There are two options: ASC - The Ascending Order and DESC - The Descending Order.
As for the third list. 
When the User is entering a number, this number is immediately inserting into the list in The Ascending Order.
The program uses a binary search algorithm to find the right place for this number.
